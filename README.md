# Joel Test Remoteâ€”The Joel Test for Remote Software Teams
## Why Do We Need Another Joel Test?
Two reasons:
- The Joel Test is from 2000 and things have changed
- We need a dedicated test just for assessing remote software teams

The Joel Test is a [12 questions test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/) from Joel Spolsky measuring how good a software team is. The test is popular because it tackles important issues. It's a fast and easy way to understand the quality of a software team and if it's worth to join from the perspective of a candidate. 

The goal is to create a new test which tells how good and remote-friendly a software team is in 2017.

This test assumes that the working language is English.
